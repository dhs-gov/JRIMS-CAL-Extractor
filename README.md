# CALPDFScanner
Notes to Self:
1. Make sure to click the PATH option when reinstalling Python.
2. The saved folder for VSC will be where the PDF documents have to be.
3. Look out for deprecation issues with PyPDF2.
4. Replace the "file" name inside extract_numbers function.
5. Don't stop believing!


Future Areas of Improvement:
1. Prevent confusion with Table of Contents values
--> Could skip pages with abnormal amount of qualifying values on it as a solution
